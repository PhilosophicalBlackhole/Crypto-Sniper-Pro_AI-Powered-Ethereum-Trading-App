# Hi, I'm Tim — aka **PhilosophicalBlackhole** 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
If you've spent any significant time looking around, you’ll probably notice a few things:

- I’m **mostly self-taught** (with plenty of bumps along the way).
- I hold a degree from UT Austin’s McCombs School of Business — Post-grad work in AIML: Business Applications.  
  *I recommend the course, but boy, was it a lot of work for a “lowly beginner” like me. (Hey, a 3.78 GPA isn’t too shabby!)*

## 🧠 About Me

- I strive for **Utility** and **Order** in my projects. Sometimes I even succeed!
- **Skill Level:** Honestly, not very good at all. But I’m a quick and eager learner, and occasionally I get a vaguely worthwhile idea.
- **Favorite idea so far:**  
  [CryptoSniper Pro](https://www.cryptosniper.pro) — an advanced Ethereum sniping bot powered by AI (and a lot of caffeine).  
  This project is a hard-fought collaboration between my own LLM AI models and myself.  
  It’s still a work in progress, but you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/PhilosophicalBlackhole/Crypto-Sniper-Pro_AI-Powered-Ethereum-Trading-App)!
